This Kraying CRM package provides a example on how to use the Microsoft Graph API for accessing mail-related data.

After installation, you can publish the package's configuration file and customize it to suit your needs.  
Make sure to set the required environment variables in your Krayin application. Below are the required environment variables for this package:

´´´
use Ghermans\MicrosoftGraphMail\MsGraphMailClient;

// Create an instance of the MsGraphMailClient
$msGraphClient = new MsGraphMailClient();

// Retrieve emails using the client
$emails = $msGraphClient->getEmails();

if ($emails === null) {
    // Handle the error appropriately
} else {
    // Process and display the emails
    return view('emails.index', ['emails' => $emails]);
}
